## Why Dexter?

It's hard to remember even simple things about the people we meet, especially if we meet lots of people!

### Recall the basics

> "I'm sorry, please remind me of your name again. I feel like I've asked you a hundred times already!"
> 
> -- <cite>Me, every time I run into the parents of my kids' classmates</cite>

Dexter helps you recall simple facts about your acquaintances so you can avoid having to ask about things you feel like you should already know.
